            <p>Hi! I'm Karen Hambro, a software developer in training at <%= link_to "Code Builders", "http://code.builders/", class: "a" %>. I have worked in the tech industry for quite a few years, most recently with <%= link_to 'Ada Developers Academy', 'http://adadevelopersacademy.org/', class: "a" %>. Having worked to place over 60 women in software development roles in local tech companies, it's now my turn to build, create, and start down the path of my own adventures in programming.

Hopefully my first big project will be a quick-find app so non-English speakers can easily know what benefits their insurance covers and what providers speak their language or offer translation. -->

            I spend my free time hanging out with my dogs, hanging out with other people's dogs, kayaking, brewing beer, taking photos, relaxing with friends and family, and dancing whenever possible.
